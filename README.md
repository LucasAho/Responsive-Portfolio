# Responsive-Portfolio
This portfolio file uses custom CSS and HTML to change website visuals based on screen width
3 specific screen sizes are set up with media queries, those being 640px, 768px, and 980px
These widths were picked to reflect normal sizes of phones, tablets, and monitors.
This repo contains three HTML files, one for each page of my portfolio, and any inconsistent classes between the pages are commented on within my CSS file, found within the assets folder. 
The contact page does not function completely as it should, and I will need to learn php to create this function.
